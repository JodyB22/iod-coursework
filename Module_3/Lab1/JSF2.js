let three = "3"
let four = "4"
let thirty = "30"
//what is the value of the following expressions?
let addition = three + four // 7 adding them together
let multiplication = three * four // 12 multipling them together
let division = three / four // .75 dividing 
let subtraction = three - four // -1 subtrating
let lessThan1 = three < four // true because 4 is bigger than 3
let lessThan2 = thirty < four // false because 30 is bigger than 4 to fix you make it let lessThan2= four < thirty
